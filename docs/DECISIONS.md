# Architecture Decisions

## [ADR-001] Brand Color Customization for Rendered Sites

**Date:** 2026-08-01  
**Status:** Approved  
**Affects:** `site_data.py` (public projection), `site_render_router.py` (rendering), `site.css` (template)  
**Effort:** D3 (implementation 2-3 days)

### Problem

All customer sites render with a hardcoded blue palette (#2a6df5 primary, #101826 header). The intake form collects `brand_colors` (primary hex from business logo/brand), but this field is intentionally excluded from the public projection (internal use only).

- **User expectation:** Sites should reflect the business's brand colors.
- **Current reality:** All sites look identical in palette.
- **Tradeoff:** Adding brand_colors to the projection expands attack surface; omitting it keeps the projection minimal.

### Decision

**Expose `brand_colors` to the public projection and inject a dynamic palette at render time.**

1. Add `brand_colors` (nullable hex string) to `build_public_site_data()` output.
2. In `site_render_router.py`, generate a 5-color palette from the brand primary (primary, darker, lighter, neutrals).
3. Inject palette as CSS custom properties into an inline `<style>` block on every page.
4. Validate contrast ratios; log warnings if AA fails, but render anyway (don't block).
5. Test: contrast edge cases, mobile rendering, XSS prevention.

### Rationale

**Why expose it:**
- Direct customer-facing content (not internal ops data).
- Hex color string is low-risk (#rrggbb, no code injection).
- Personalization benefit outweighs minimal risk.

**Why inject dynamically:**
- Stateless rendering (no per-tenant CSS files).
- Fits Vercel serverless model.
- Contrast validation at render time catches bad brand choices.

**Why deterministic algorithm:**
- One primary → automatic palette (HSL-based darkening/lightening).
- Zero designer cost per tenant.
- Fallback to default if brand_colors is null.

### Implementation Stages

**Stage 1:** Add `brand_colors` to public projection + hex validation  
**Stage 2:** Palette generation function (primary → 5-color dict via HSL)  
**Stage 3:** Contrast validation (warn, don't block)  
**Stage 4:** Template injection (CSS vars in `<style>` block)  
**Stage 5:** Tests + docs  

### Trade-offs

| Choice | Benefit | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|---------|------|-----------|
| Expose brand_colors | Personalization | Slight surface expansion | Hex validation only |
| Deterministic palette | No cost, consistent | May not match intent | Log warnings, manual override in phase 3 |
| Warn on contrast fail | Respects business choice | Poor contrast rendering | Log prominently, email founder weekly |

### Rollout

1. Ship stages 1-4 together.
2. Feature flag: `ENABLE_BRAND_COLORS=true` env var (off by default).
3. Verify on preview deploy with test tenants.
4. Flip to default-on after verification.
5. Monitor contrast warnings weekly.

### Rollback

- Client: override CSS vars in console.
- Server: set `brand_colors = null` for tenant (revert to default).
- Kill switch: `ENABLE_BRAND_COLORS=false` (all sites → default palette).

### Questions for Founder

1. **Contrast enforcement:** Block sites with contrast < 4.5:1, or warn + render?  
   *Current plan: Warn + render.*
2. **Premium design:** Hand-tuned palettes for premium tiers?  
   *Current plan: All deterministic, premium override in phase 3.*

## [ADR-002] Custom Domains for Rendered Sites (Phase 2)

**Date:** 2026-08-01  
**Status:** Approved  
**Affects:** `tenants` table, `app.py` (middleware), `site_render_router.py` (documentation)  
**Effort:** D2 (implemented in 1 session)

### Problem

Tenants want to serve sites at custom domains (e.g., `desertcooling.com`) instead of the default `/sites/{tenant_id}/web` path. Presently, all sites live under WebStaffr's path structure with no custom domain support.

### Decision

**Add a `custom_domain` column to tenants and implement path-rewriting middleware to transparently route custom domains to the internal path-based handler.**

### Implementation

1. **Database:** Add `custom_domain` (nullable TEXT, non-unique) column to tenants table.
2. **Resolver:** `resolve_tenant_from_host()` function queries custom_domain column, handles port stripping and case normalization.
3. **Middleware:** `CustomDomainMiddleware` intercepts all requests, checks Host header, resolves tenant_id, rewrites path before FastAPI routing.
   - Custom domain request: `desertcooling.com/about` → internally routed as `/sites/{tenant_id}/web/about`
   - Path-based request: unchanged, routes normally.
   - Non-matching Host: passthrough (no-op).
4. **Routes:** Reuse existing path-based handlers; no route duplication.

### Why Middleware vs Duplicate Routes

- **Avoids routing conflicts:** Identical paths can't have multiple handlers in FastAPI.
- **Centralizes logic:** One place to manage custom domain resolution.
- **Reuses handlers:** Existing path-based rendering pipeline unchanged.
- **Transparent:** Tenant code sees no difference; all routing logic in middleware.

### Trade-offs

| Choice | Benefit | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|---------|------|-----------|
| Middleware-based | Clean routing, no duplication | Harder to debug | Log Host header and rewritten path on dispatch |
| Nullable column (no unique constraint) | Avoid SQLite migration issues | Application must prevent duplicates | Single query per request (negligible cost) |
| Host header lookup | Automatic domain → tenant resolution | Port parsing complexity | Handle `:` stripping, lowercase normalization |

### Testing

- 12 new unit tests for middleware path rewriting, resolution, isolation.
- All 381 existing tests still pass (zero regressions).
- Tests cover: empty hosts, port stripping, subpaths (services, sitemap, robots), passthrough, state tracking.

### Rollout

1. Ship with brand colors (ADR-001).
2. Feature flag optional (`ENABLE_CUSTOM_DOMAINS=true` env var, off by default).
3. Verify on preview with test tenant pointing to custom domain via DNS.
4. Flip to default-on after validation.

### Rollback

- Remove `custom_domain` value for tenant (revert to path-based).
- Kill switch: stop including `CustomDomainMiddleware` in app.py.

### Future (Phase 3+)

- SSL provisioning for custom domains (Let's Encrypt via Vercel, zero-trust model).
- CNAME validation endpoint (/domain-verification/{token}).
- Dashboard UI for domain management (intake redesign).

## [ADR-003] Premium Design Variations (Phase 3)

**Date:** 2026-08-01  
**Status:** Backlog

Design variations (modern, minimal, bold) from Silex/Mobirise mockups.

**Defer until founder provides design direction.**

## [ADR-021] WebStaffr Brand Color Doctrine (Locked)

**Date:** 2026-08-03
**Status:** Approved (founder-locked)
**Affects:** `WEBSTAFFR_GOVERNANCE.md` (Visual Identity), Site Magic's default direction, all future WebStaffr-owned marketing surfaces
**Effort:** D1 (doc update, no code change)

### Problem

`WEBSTAFFR_GOVERNANCE.md`'s Visual Identity section (last updated 2026-07-18) specified an approximate two-color logo treatment (gray/gold split, deep blue `#1f4d78` unified) with no defined marketing-site palette. The founder has since built and approved a full landing page (`webstaffr-standalone.html`) with a complete four-color system, dark mode, and a refined logo treatment. That page is now the reference implementation for WebStaffr's own brand identity, and is the basis Site Magic's generator should draw its default direction from.

### Decision

**Lock the following as WebStaffr's canonical color doctrine, superseding the prior approximate values:**

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Navy | `#000080` | Primary brand color. Headlines, primary text, unified-logo mark, primary CTA on light backgrounds, hero gradient base. |
| Royal Blue | `#4169E1` | Secondary accent. Links, secondary CTAs, icon accents, focus/interactive states. |
| Orange | `#FF6600` | Highlight/energy accent. Primary CTA fill, "Staffr" wordmark color (both logo variants), focus-visible outline color. |
| Gray | `#E0E0E0` | Neutral surface. Page background, card fills, muted section backgrounds. |

**Supporting tones (extracted from the locked implementation, not independently chosen):**
- Navy scale (light-to-dark UI depth, all four used across surfaces/dark mode): `#000080` -> `#000066` -> `#00005A` -> `#000055` -> `#000040`. Footer: `#00004D`.
- Orange tint (icon backgrounds, light mode): `#FFE0CC`.
- Royal blue pressed state: `#2E4FC9`.
- Muted body text: `#5d6880` (light), standard slate grays in dark mode.
- Success/error states use standard semantic colors (emerald/red), not brand colors -- these were never part of brand identity and stay unchanged.

**Logo (Garamond Bold Italic, one size larger than surrounding text):**
- Split (default, light backgrounds): "Web" `#999999`, "Staffr" `#FF6600`.
- Dark (on navy backgrounds): "Web" `#cccccc`, "Staffr" `#FF6600`.
- Unified (monochrome contexts): both words `#000080`.

This corrects two values in the prior doctrine: "Staffr" moves from gold `#bf9000` to orange `#FF6600`, and the unified variant moves from deep blue `#1f4d78` to navy `#000080`. The gray split color (`#999999`) is unchanged.

**Typography:** Garamond (logo only, italic bold) + Manrope (all UI text, weights 400-800).

### Rationale

The founder built and explicitly locked this palette by reviewing the finished landing page, not by picking hex values in the abstract -- the doctrine here is a transcription of an approved artifact, not a new design decision made by Claude. Recording it as an ADR (rather than only updating the governance doc) preserves the "why" for whoever builds Site Magic's default direction: the palette isn't arbitrary, it's traceable to one approved reference implementation.

### Consequences

- `WEBSTAFFR_GOVERNANCE.md`'s Visual Identity section is updated to match (this ADR is the record of why).
- Site Magic's direction engine, when generating a default/fallback direction (no per-tenant brand override), should treat this four-color system as WebStaffr's own house style -- distinct from the dynamic per-tenant `brand_colors` palette system in `DESIGN.md`, which remains customer-brand-driven and unaffected by this decision.
- Any future WebStaffr-owned marketing surface (investor site, agency site, this landing page) should be checked against this table rather than eyeballed.

### Known gap (logged, not fixed here)

`ADR-020` (em-dash governance rule, 2026-07-30) is referenced in `TASKS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` but was never written into this file. Backfilling it is a separate, trivial doc task -- flagged in `TASKS.md`, not done inline here to keep this ADR scoped to the color decision.

## [ADR-022] Engineering Director Operating Rule (Locked)

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Approved (founder-locked)
**Affects:** All WebStaffr project work, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

### Decision

All WebStaffr engineering work follows the Engineering Director operating rule in `AGENTS.md`:

- Exhaust available capabilities before asking the founder for mechanical work or information a tool can retrieve.
- Classify work D0-D4 by reversibility, precedent, and blast radius.
- Make routine engineering decisions directly; do not hand equivalent implementation choices back to the founder.
- Reserve founder approval for product direction, customer experience, cost, legal, vendors, credentials, production data, schema changes, pushes, and deploys.
- Use assessment -> decision -> action -> report, with depth-calibrated compression and specific verification evidence.
- Verify the production checkout and GitHub repository before building.
- Record a concise delta-only handoff when the founder closes a session.

### Rationale

The founder is the product owner, not the engineering referee. Mechanical questions and implementation menus waste founder context and increase the chance of work landing in the wrong repository or at the wrong process depth. The rule preserves founder authority over consequential decisions while making the engineering function accountable for execution.

### Consequences

- `AGENTS.md` is the operational source for this process.
- `CLAUDE.md` points to it and removes conflicting single-agent wording.
- Existing security, tenant isolation, testing, credential, git, and deployment approval rules remain in force.
- Higher-priority platform and safety requirements continue to override repository instructions where applicable.

## ADR-023: Workers Send Automatically; Customer Intervenes, Does Not Pre-Approve

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted (founder decision)
**Depth:** D4 (product direction, customer experience)

### Decision

Rita's review responses and Sam's quotes send automatically on their trigger. The customer can override, amend, configure, and stop them, but does not approve each send in advance.

### Rationale

The product promise is staff that works, not a queue that waits for the owner. An approval gate on every send reintroduces the owner's attention as the bottleneck, which is the exact cost WebStaffr exists to remove. A home-service owner on a roof is not clearing an approval queue.

### Consequences

- TCPA/DNC compliance review becomes a hard gate on any automated outbound rather than a review step. Nothing sends until it clears.
- The never-fabricate invariant becomes load-bearing rather than advisory: auto-sent copy may not invent remedies, discounts, timelines, or facts absent from the tenant record.
- Negative reviews (1 to 2 star) escalate to a human with a suggested draft instead of auto-responding.
- Every tenant gets a per-worker kill switch that takes effect immediately without support contact.
- Every auto-send is logged as a reversible event: content, timestamp, trigger.
- Rate ceilings are required to contain webhook-loop failure modes.
- The portal's Reviews and Quotes screens become audit trails plus controls, not approval queues.

## ADR-024: Customer Portal Is Business Manager Tier

**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Status:** Accepted (founder decision)
**Depth:** D4 (pricing, product packaging)

### Decision

The customer portal ships in the Business Manager tier ($2,497/mo). Office Staff ($497/mo) does not include it.

### Rationale

The portal is the clearest visible difference between the tiers and the strongest upgrade lever available. Bundling it at $497 spends that leverage for nothing.

### Consequences

- Tier gating requires resolving the plan-name drift first: `webstaffr/intake.py`'s `VALID_PLANS` is `{essentials, pro, growth}` while pricing surfaces use Office Staff / Business Manager / White-Glove. No mapping exists between them. A tier check cannot be written against a tier name the code does not have. This becomes a Phase 3 prerequisite.
- Office Staff tenants need a non-portal proof-of-value surface. A weekly summary email built on the same `activity_events` data covers it and doubles as the upgrade pitch.
- Office Staff tenants see the Overview screen with their real numbers and deeper screens visibly gated, rather than a 403. The portal is a conversion surface for them, not a locked door.

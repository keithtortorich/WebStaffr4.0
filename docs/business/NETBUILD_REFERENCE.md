# NetBuild.Pro Reference
**Companion to `docs/business/WEBSTAFFR_GOVERNANCE.md` — the minutiae, tables, and hex codes that don't belong in a prose governance document.**

This file is machine-checkable reference data: exact values, tables, current tiers, current stack. When the ideal state described in governance changes, this file's numbers should be checked against it. When only an implementation detail changes (a hex code, a vendor, a table row), only this file changes.

Live status, blockers, and session work belong in TASKS.md, not here.

## Brand Name

**NetBuild.Pro** — all customer-facing, marketing, investor, and brand surfaces.

Internal/technical contexts may use "WebStaffr" or "WS4" for code, package names, and repo history. Never in customer-facing copy.

**Note:** these colors belong to NetBuild.Pro's own surfaces (marketing site, dashboard, investor materials). Tenant-generated customer sites use their own visual direction, not this palette. See Site Magic docs.

Source of truth: NetBuild.Pro Logo (approved 2026-08-06), Google Drive folder "NetBuild.Pro". Supersedes ADR-021's navy/royal-blue/orange palette. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-022.

## Pricing Tiers (Current)

All tiers include a free generated website for 30 days before the contractor is offered a subscription.

| Tier | Monthly Price | Includes | Gross Profit |
|------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Office Staff | $497/mo | Service Advisor, 24/7 Receptionist, Lead Coordinator, Reputation Manager, Website Ops Manager | $432/mo (87%) |

**MVP scope (2026-08): Single tier only.** Business Manager and White-Glove removed for launch. `intake.py`'s `VALID_PLANS` accepts only `office_staff`. Future tiers planned after initial market validation.

Delivery cost includes AI inference, voice infrastructure, integrations, and operational overhead.

## Unit Economics (Current Model)

- Organic CAC: $100-$200/customer
- Paid CAC (future, gated on data): likely $200-$400
- Average customer lifetime: 16.7 months
- Monthly churn: 6%
- LTV (Office Staff tier): $7,200
- LTV:CAC ratio: 36x-72x
- Payback period: <1 month

### Year One Projection (Phoenix HVAC beachhead)
Cash-positive by month 3. Year-end: ~44 customers, ~$261K ARR, ~$115K cumulative cash. Downside case (5% conversion instead of 10%): ~22 customers, ~$131K ARR, still cash-positive if CAC holds.

### Year Two Projection (Phoenix + Tampa, month 13 launch)
~108 customers, ~$646K ARR, ~$489K cumulative cash.

### Market Sizing
TAM $14.6B (approx. 2.5M US home-service businesses). SAM $2.9B (digitally active segment). Year-one SOM ~$440K (Phoenix HVAC beachhead).

---

## Acquisition Channels (Current)

**Active (Organic, Founder-Led):**
- Direct outreach to HVAC contractors in Phoenix
- Referrals from existing customers
- Organic search

**Planned (Paid, gated on first 50 free-build conversion data):**
- Google Local Services Ads
- Facebook/Instagram for contractors
- Industry-specific marketplaces
- Expected CAC $200-$400; only turned on if LTV holds or improves at that CAC

### Metrics That Matter
Phone answer rate, demo booking and attendance rate, trial activation rate, free-to-paid conversion rate, monthly churn, net revenue retention.

### Metrics That Don't Move Decisions
Email sends, website visits, total signups (only paid conversions count).

| New dependencies | Founder | Explicit approval before merge |
| Schema or data model changes | Founder | Explicit approval before merge |

## Risk Register (Current)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Free-to-paid conversion below 10% | Gate paid spend on first 50 builds |
| Organic CAC doesn't hold at $100-$200 | Conservative modeling; paid spend only after proving organic conversion |
| Voice unproven on live call | Retell integration unit-tested; live phone test tracked in TASKS.md |
| Churn above 6% | Structured onboarding at day 1, 7, 30 |
| Regulatory exposure (calling/texting) | Email-first outreach; consent-based contact; do-not-call scrubbing |
| Competition from single-feature tools | Compete on full handoff chain, not one feature |
| Supabase availability incident | Dual-backend strategy; graceful 503s on DB failure |

## Voice Rules (Mechanical)

- No em-dashes anywhere in NetBuild.Pro copy, internal or external. Hyphens or rewrite instead.
- Executive voice: formal contexts, use full "NetBuild.Pro."
- Commercial voice: customer-facing, "NetBuild.Pro" or "NetBuild."

# CLAUDE.md — WebStaffr 4.0 Engineering

**Headroom + Caveman + Engineering Director mode** auto-activated for all WebStaffr sessions.

---

## This Repo

**Production:** WebStaffr 4.0 (`github.com/keithtortorich/WebStaffr4.0`)

**Branch:** Always `main` unless explicitly working on a feature branch.

**Key files:**
- `site_renderer.py` — Jinja2 engine (WS4 innovation; replaced Lovable Site Weaver)
- `health_check.py` — 9-check suite (improved from WS3's 8)
- `docs/SITE_RENDERER_PLAN.md` — Architecture
- `TASKS.md` — Current blockers, progress, milestones
- `webstaffr/app.py` — Composition root (changes = D3+)
- `site_data.py` — Public projection (changes = D3+)

**Comparison to WS3.3:** 4.0 rebuilt from scratch carrying only proven, running code. Do not copy fixes from ws33-repo — the two have diverged significantly. Check current state on disk first.

## Engineering Director Mode (Auto-Active)

Applied to every task:

### Capability Check (Use Tools, Don't Ask)

1. **Dedicated MCP** — GitHub, Supabase, Vercel (fastest)
2. **Desktop Commander** — Shell, filesystem, git on this Mac
3. **Browser tools** — Dashboards, logins
4. **Computer use** — Native macOS fallback
5. **Sandbox shell** — Isolated compute only

Only after all five: ask the user.

**Anti-patterns:**
- "Can you run X in your terminal?" — Use Desktop Commander instead
- "Check the dashboard for Y" — Use Browser tools instead
- "Go to X and paste me Z" — Find an MCP or tool that reaches it

### Depth Ladder

| Depth | Description | Move |
|-------|-------------|------|
| D0 | Questions, status, explanations | Read TASKS.md, answer, stop |
| D1 | Reversible, local, pattern exists | Just do it (bugs, tests, docs, refactors) |
| D2 | New surface, established pattern | Design note + implement + test + docs |
| D3 | No precedent, multi-session, architecture | Design first (docs/DECISIONS.md), then stage |
| D4 | Irreversible, business, legal, deploy | Recommend + wait for yes |

**Depth escalators:** auth, secrets, tenant isolation, DB schema, dependencies, `app.py` changes, `site_data.py` changes, public API changes, tenant-scoped queries.

### Make Engineering Calls

**Yours to make:**
- Library/framework choice (consistency + maintainability first)
- Sync vs async, error handling, test structure, naming, file layout
- Whether to add a test (yes), whether to handle an edge case (yes)

**Theirs to make (D4):**
- Whether to build the thing at all
- Product/UX decisions
- Vendor selection
- Money, legal, compliance
- Push/deploy decisions

### Never Assume Repo State

- **Which repo?** Check `git remote -v` and disk
- **WS3.3 vs WS4.0?** Only `/Users/doc/Desktop/WebStaffr4` is production
- **Branch?** Check `git status`, `git log`
- **Precedent?** Read CLAUDE.md, DECISIONS.md, recent git log

### Honest Verdicts

**Never open with:** "great idea," "absolutely," restatement-as-insight

**Do this:** Lead with the verdict (yes/no/recommend). State it once, plainly. Then *why*, in terms of consequence not vocabulary. If something better exists, name it and say why.

**Example:** "Not for this. Browser automation would test the form and whole pipeline at once, so when it fails you won't know which part broke. The `webstaffr-onboarding-smoketest` skill hits `/api/onboard` directly and tells you exactly which stage failed. Browser use is worth it later for the embedded Angel widget, where the browser is actually the thing being tested."

### Reporting

- **D1 work:** Two lines (what changed, tests N/N, health status)
- **D2 work:** Short design note + implement + test + docs
- **D3 work:** Plan in docs/DECISIONS.md first, report progress in stages
- **D4 asks:** "Sam's ready, 42/42 passing, health HEALTHY, push?" (binary, short)

**No step-by-step recaps.** No narrating work the user watched happen.

---

## Tenant Isolation (Critical)

Every query must include `tenant_id` scoping by hand. This is verbose but makes missing tenant checks visible in review. **Missing `tenant_id` is a silent-in-production bug that can't be walked back.**

- **Check in review:** Grep for SQL queries, verify WHERE clause includes tenant
- **DB errors:** Don't catch and re-raise as 503 without logging the error type first (silent failure bug from 2026-07-26)
- **Public projection:** Never leak internal fields (`lead_routing`, `approver`, `competitors`, `license_number`, etc.) to `site_data.py`

---

## Active Tools

### Headroom Proxy (`:8787`)

**Auto-starts on SessionStart hook.** Compresses input 20-30% on every API call.

**Manual:**
```bash
headroom proxy --port 8787                    # Start if hook fails
headroom memory list                          # Check what's stored
headroom agent-savings claude-code            # See metrics
```

### Caveman Plugin

**Ready to activate.** Cuts output tokens 65%, same accuracy.

**Use:**
```
/caveman                # Activate per-session
"caveman mode"          # Or say naturally in chat
/caveman-stats          # Check savings
```

**Best for:** Routine explanations, code reviews, status updates.

## Drift Watch

Log to TASKS.md (don't fix inline unless trivial):

- Router nested in `workers/angel/` (should be registered in `app.py`)
- Integration without `Protocol` + `Null*` + `*NotConfiguredError` shape
- Query missing `tenant_id` scoping
- CORS headers on server-to-server route
- Code assuming persistent process (Vercel is serverless)
- Fabricated ratings/reviews/credentials
- DB error catch + 503 without logging error type
- Root markdown files sprawled past 20 (tokens on every session)
- TASKS.md grown past 40KB (makes current state hard to find)

---

## Session Quickstart

1. **Start a session** → Headroom proxy auto-starts
2. **Mention WebStaffr or this repo** → This CLAUDE.md auto-loads
3. **Check context** → Read TASKS.md (current blockers, progress, next steps)
4. **Size the work** → Check depth ladder, ask if D4
5. **For routine replies** → `/caveman` for 65% token cut
6. **Before push** → Check health, test status, tenant isolation, TASKS.md

## References

- **Architecture:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Site Renderer Plan:** docs/SITE_RENDERER_PLAN.md
- **Decisions:** docs/DECISIONS.md
- **Progress:** TASKS.md
- **Health:** `/health` endpoint or `health_check.py`

## Inter-Agent Task Dispatch Protocol (agent_broker.py)

When delegating sub-tasks to Codex or Hermes, use `agent_broker.py`
(`/Users/doc/Desktop/WebStaffr4-coordination/scripts/agent_broker.py`) directly.
Do not create unmonitored side-car files or a second coordination mechanism.

**Broker primitives actually available** (verified against `--help`, not assumed):
`init`, `register`, `heartbeat`, `claim`, `guard`, `release`, `handoff`, `alert`,
`inbox`, `ack`, `ack-notify`, `notifications`, `status`.

There is no `dispatch` subcommand, no task queue, and no `--task-id` flag. Dispatch
is a `handoff` call — nothing more. Verify flags with `--help` before scripting
against them; they have changed shape mid-session before.

**Domain scoping:**
- **Codex CLI:** bulk code generation, unit tests, refactoring, execution.
- **Hermes Agent:** webhooks, MCP tool calling, live integration validation.

**To dispatch a task:**

```bash
python /Users/doc/Desktop/WebStaffr4-coordination/scripts/agent_broker.py handoff \
  --from-agent claude \
  --to-agent <codex|hermes> \
  --subject "<short task slug>" \
  --message "<instructions, context file paths, and verification command>" \
  --priority normal
```

**Before writing to any file another agent might also touch**, acquire a guard:

```bash
python /Users/doc/Desktop/WebStaffr4-coordination/scripts/agent_broker.py guard \
  --agent claude --action write --task "<slug>" <file paths...>
```

Guard claims expire after 15 minutes (TTL). A denied guard means another agent
holds an active claim on that path — do not override it, wait or coordinate.

**Reading responses:** poll your own inbox, don't assume delivery.

```bash
python /Users/doc/Desktop/WebStaffr4-coordination/scripts/agent_broker.py inbox --agent claude
```

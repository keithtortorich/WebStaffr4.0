# WebStaffr Credentials & Onboarding

## Required Environment Variables

### 1. `GROK_API_KEY` (for `GrokVoiceBackend`)
- **Purpose**: enables real chat via xAI's Grok API in Angel.
- **How to get**: your xAI account's API key management page. `[Unverified]`
  the exact current URL -- check xAI's own docs rather than trusting a
  hardcoded link here, since these change.
- **Behavior**:
  - Set -> `GrokVoiceBackend` is used (see `webstaffr/workers/angel/voice.py`).
  - Unset -> falls back to `NullVoiceBackend` (safe, deterministic, no
    external calls).
- **Security**: never commit. Use a local, gitignored `.env` file or your
  shell environment.

### 2. `GHL_API_KEY` + `GHL_LOCATION_ID` (for `GoHighLevelClient`)
- **Purpose**: real appointment and note syncing to GoHighLevel.
- **How to get**: GoHighLevel's developer/API settings for your location.
- **Behavior**:
  - Both set -> real `GoHighLevelClient` is used.
  - Either missing -> `NullGHLClient` (records calls in memory, no network
    calls -- safe default for tests and unconfigured tenants).
- **Status**: `create_appointment`, `log_note`, `update_appointment`, and
  `cancel_appointment` are all implemented (see
  `webstaffr/workers/angel/ghl.py`). GHL sync calls in `Angel` retry up
  to 3 times (configurable via `Angel(..., ghl_max_attempts=N)`) before
  giving up and logging the failure -- a sync failure never blocks a
  booking or a conversation turn.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

### 3. `RETELL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (for Retell AI voice/telephony webhooks)
- **Purpose**: verifies that `/retell/webhook` and `/retell/function-call`
  requests actually came from Retell before trusting the payload.
- **How to get**: issued by Retell when you register a webhook in their
  dashboard.
- **Behavior**:
  - Set -> `RetellSignatureVerifier` is used (HMAC-SHA256 over the raw
    request body).
  - Unset -> requests are denied. Tests may inject
    `NullRetellWebhookVerifier` explicitly.
- **Tenant resolution**: each tenant's Retell agent/phone number must be
  configured in the Retell dashboard with `metadata: {"tenant_id": "..."}`
  -- Retell echoes this back on every webhook/function-call payload for
  that call. There is no phone-number-to-tenant lookup table (a real
  schema change, not done); this is a first-slice design for a handful of
  pilot tenants configured by hand.
- **Not required to receive webhooks**: `RETELL_API_KEY` is not needed for
  `/retell/webhook` or `/retell/function-call` to work -- it would only be
  needed for this app to call Retell's own management API, which nothing
  in this repo does yet.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

### 4. `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (for `/webhooks/ghl` shared-secret auth)
- **Purpose**: verifies that `/webhooks/ghl` requests actually came from
  GoHighLevel before trusting the payload -- `tenant_id` alone is public,
  not a credential.
- **How to get**: not issued by GHL -- you choose this value yourself and
  configure it as a custom header (`X-Webhook-Secret: <value>`) on
  GoHighLevel's workflow Webhook action. GHL does not sign outgoing
  webhooks itself, so a shared secret set on both sides is the mechanism.
- **Behavior**:
  - Set -> `StaticSecretVerifier` checks the `X-Webhook-Secret` header
    (constant-time comparison); missing or mismatched -> `401`.
  - Unset -> requests are denied. Tests may inject
    `NullSharedSecretVerifier` explicitly.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

### 5. `BOOK_API_KEY` (for `/book` shared-secret auth)
- **Purpose**: verifies the caller of `/book` before letting it create an
  appointment for an arbitrary `tenant_id`.
- **How to get**: not issued by anything external -- you choose this value
  and give it to whatever calls `/book` directly (there is no live caller
  today; this is for a future booking UI or server-side integration).
- **Behavior**:
  - Set -> `StaticSecretVerifier` checks the `X-API-Key` header; missing or
    mismatched -> `401`.
  - Unset -> requests are denied. Tests may inject
    `NullSharedSecretVerifier` explicitly.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

### 6. `INTERNAL_API_KEY` (for Sam, Rita, and Leo internal routes)
- **Purpose**: authenticates callers of `/quotes/*`,
  `/workers/rita/draft-response`, and `/leo/score`.
- **How to get**: choose a cryptographically random value and share it only
  with the approved server-side caller.
- **Behavior**:
  - Set -> `StaticSecretVerifier` checks `X-API-Key`; missing or mismatched
    requests receive `401`.
  - Unset -> every protected internal request is denied.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

### 7. `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (customer authentication)
- **Purpose**: verifies customer dashboard bearer tokens against Supabase
  Auth before resolving a local session and tenant membership.
- **Behavior**:
  - Both set -> customer identity verification calls the project's
    `/auth/v1/user` endpoint.
  - Either missing -> `/auth/session`, `/auth/logout`, and private
    `/tenants/{tenant_id}/*` routes fail closed with `401`.
- **Session flow**: after Supabase sign-in, call `POST /auth/session` with
  the access token. Repeat after token refresh so the local expiry follows
  the newly issued access token. Call `POST /auth/logout` before signing
  out of Supabase for immediate application-side revocation.
- **Authorization data**: roles come only from `tenant_memberships` in
  trusted storage. User-editable Supabase metadata is never authoritative.
- **Security**: the publishable key is not a service-role secret, but keep
  environment configuration centralized. Never use a Supabase secret or
  service-role key in a browser client.

### 8. `SERVICETITAN_CLIENT_ID` + `SERVICETITAN_CLIENT_SECRET` + `SERVICETITAN_TENANT_ID` (+ optional `SERVICETITAN_BASE_URL`)
- **Purpose**: read-first polling of jobs, customers, appointments, invoices,
  payments, locations, projects, installed equipment, and technicians.
- **Behavior**:
  - All three required vars set -> `webstaffr/integrations/servicetitan/client.py`
    builds a real `ServiceTitanClient`. Missing any one raises
    `ServiceTitanNotConfiguredError` at construction time.
  - `SERVICETITAN_ENABLED=true` also required to mount the
    `POST /integrations/servicetitan/poll` route at all (see `webstaffr/app.py`).
- **Status**: code exists and is tested (`tests/test_servicetitan.py`), but
  wiring this live is explicitly post-MVP per this repo's `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

### 9. `WEBSTAFFR_DB_PATH` / `DATABASE_URL`
- **Purpose**: `WEBSTAFFR_DB_PATH` sets the local SQLite file path for dev.
  `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres/Supabase) switches the app to the dual-backend
  Postgres path -- see `webstaffr/db.py`.
- **WebStaffr 4.0 status**: this repo is intended to be re-pointed at the
  same Supabase project WS3.3 was using -- see `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
  for the exact cutover steps, including the two Postgres migrations
  (`postgres_manual/0007_social_media.sql`, `0008_execution_nodes.sql`)
  that must be applied before this repo goes live against it.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

### 10. `KOKORO_TTS_URL` (optional)
- **Purpose**: when set, `POST /v1/audio/speech` proxies OpenAI-compatible
  TTS requests to this external Kokoro backend instead of the route not
  existing at all.
- **Behavior**: unset -> the route is not mounted; no new dependency or
  model hosting required in this repo either way.
- **Security**: never commit if it embeds any credential in the URL.

### 11. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` + `DESIGN_CRITIQUE_MODEL` (optional, for `OpenRouterDesignCritiqueClient`)
- **Purpose**: on-demand design/UI critique of one rendered tenant site
  page (`scripts/design_critique.py`) -- founder- or session-invoked, not
  part of any automatic path. `site_renderer.py`'s render path and
  `scripts/health_check.py`'s a11y check
  (`webstaffr/site_a11y_check.py`) both stay free and mechanical; this is
  the separate, judgment-based half, which costs real per-call money and
  therefore never runs unattended.
- **How to get**: an OpenRouter account API key (openrouter.ai).
- **Behavior**:
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set -> `OpenRouterDesignCritiqueClient` is used.
  - Unset -> `NullDesignCritiqueClient` (no network call, returns a plain
    "not configured" message) -- safe default for tests and any
    environment that hasn't opted in.
  - `DESIGN_CRITIQUE_MODEL` optional, defaults to a cheap OpenRouter model
    tier (`meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` as of 2026-08-01) -- override
    without a code change if OpenRouter's pricing or lineup shifts.
- **Security**: never commit. Same as above.

## Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Create .env in the repo root (already gitignored -- see .gitignore)
cat > .env << 'EOF'
GROK_API_KEY=your_xai_key_here
GHL_API_KEY=your_ghl_key_here
GHL_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id_here
RETELL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_retell_webhook_signing_secret_here
GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=choose_your_own_shared_secret_here
BOOK_API_KEY=choose_your_own_api_key_here
INTERNAL_API_KEY=choose_a_separate_internal_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
WEBSTAFFR_DB_PATH=./webstaffr.db
EOF

# 2. Run with real backends
export $(cat .env | xargs)
uvicorn webstaffr.app:app --reload
```

## Testing

- The full test suite always runs, regardless of environment -- nothing
  is conditionally skipped based on whether credentials are set.
- Credential-check tests explicitly clear the relevant env var to verify
  the "not configured" error path.
- Behavior tests pass an explicit fake key to exercise the real logic
  without needing a live account, then mock the actual network call
  rather than hitting a real API. No test in this suite makes a real
  network call.
- Run the full suite: `python -m pytest`
- Run the self-healing health check: `python scripts/health_check.py`

## Production Notes

- Use a real secret manager for deployment (Vercel's Sensitive env vars,
  not a `.env` file) -- `.env` is a local development convenience only.
- Watch logs for `VoiceBackendNotConfiguredError` / `GHLNotConfiguredError`
  (raised at construction if credentials are missing) and for
  `ghl_call_attempt_failed` / `ghl_sync_failed` / `ghl_note_log_failed`
  (logged, not raised, when a configured GHL call still fails after
  retrying).
- `angel_db_connection_failed`, `site_data_db_connection_failed`,
  `intake_db_connection_failed`, `attribution_db_connection_failed` are
  logged with `error_type=<exception class name>` only, never the raw
  exception message -- a Postgres error can embed the connection string
  (host, user). Never widen these log calls to include `str(exc)`.

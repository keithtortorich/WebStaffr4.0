## Product Vision
WebStaffr is an AI employee platform: an extension of a business's team through configurable AI workers, not a bundle of point automations. The product should read as workforce, not tooling.

## Target Users
- Small and mid-sized service businesses (SMBs) : the core end-customer.
- Agencies and resellers who deploy and manage WebStaffr on behalf of their own clients.
- Individual operators who want additional staffing coverage without adding headcount.

## Core Value Proposition
An AI workforce layer that takes on the recurring, people-shaped work of running a business : answering, following up, coordinating, following through : so an operator gets employee-equivalent coverage without growing payroll. The value is staffing, not software features.

## High-Level Capabilities (abstract)
- Voice : handling and responding to calls.
- Chat : handling text-based conversation.
- Workflows : coordinating multi-step business processes.
- Integrations : connecting into the tools a business already uses.

## Business Intent : What Success Looks Like
- Operators experience WebStaffr as reliable staff, not administered software.
- Customers expand from a single AI worker to a fuller AI workforce over time.
- Agencies can resell and white-label the platform to their own client base.
- Retention is driven by trust in coverage, not by lock-in.

## Non-Technical Roadmap Themes
- **Depth** : growing from one AI worker to a multi-role AI workforce per customer.
- **Breadth** : expanding the range of business functions covered.
- **Trust** : building operator confidence in autonomous, unsupervised action.
- **Channel** : direct-to-business and agency-mediated distribution as parallel paths to market.

This repo's scope is defined in `CLAUDE.md` (MVP, backend, Angel worker, integration bridges, tests). WebStaffr 4.0 is a clean rebuild of WS3.3, carrying forward only proven, running code -- see `docs/DECISIONS.md` for what changed and why.

## MVP Scope (this repo)
Full flow: intake → generated customer site → Angel widget embedded and working, plus live voice via Retell. Frontend/site-generation is delegated to Lovable; this repo owns backend logic (Angel, tenant isolation, GHL/voice integration, attribution, integration bridges, tests).

## Post-MVP Roadmap

- **Business Manager Tier -- Marketing Coordinator.** `social-media-marketing-machine` (a separate, self-contained repo -- github.com/keithtortorich/smmm), combined with the `marketing-director-gtm` skill, is designated as the future "Marketing Coordinator" AI-employee role -- the crux of the Business Manager Tier upgrade. Combination plan drafted (`docs/MARKETING_COORDINATOR_PLAN.md`); implementation not started.
- **ServiceTitan tie-in.** Client code exists (`webstaffr/integrations/servicetitan/`), tested against mocks, not yet wired to a live account. One open design decision (socket workflow format) blocking that pass -- see TASKS.md.

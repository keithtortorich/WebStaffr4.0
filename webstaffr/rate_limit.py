"""Per-tenant, per-endpoint request rate limiting.

Backed by the existing db.py connection layer (SQLite locally, Postgres/
Supabase in production) rather than a new external dependency (Redis,
Upstash, Vercel KV). That was an explicit choice, not a default: this app
runs as Vercel serverless functions with no persistent process (see
CLAUDE.md's hosting invariant), so an in-memory counter would only ever
enforce a limit within a single warm instance -- Vercel's multiple/cold-
started instances would each get their own counter, giving no real ceiling
in production. A DB-backed counter is correctly shared across every
instance because the count lives in the database, not process memory, and
needs no new vendor relationship (see the matching CLAUDE.md addendum,
2026-07-08, for the tradeoff this was weighed against).

[Inference] This is a fixed-window counter, not sliding-window or token-
bucket: simpler, and precise enough to bound the actual risk this closes
-- an unauthenticated caller running up real, billed xAI usage with no
ceiling -- at the cost of allowing up to ~2x the nominal limit in the
worst case across a window boundary (e.g. a burst at the end of one
window and another at the start of the next). That imprecision is an
accepted MVP-stage tradeoff, not an oversight.

DEFAULT_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW is a round, conservative placeholder, not
derived from measured traffic -- no real customer usage data exists yet.
Tune once real usage patterns exist.

Known gap, not fixed here: rows in rate_limit_counters are never pruned.
At MVP request volumes this is not a practical concern, but nothing
automatically deletes old windows -- add a cleanup migration or scheduled
job before this matters at real production volume.

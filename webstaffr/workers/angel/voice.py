"""Voice/chat backend abstraction for Angel.

Kept as an explicit interface so Angel's logic never depends on a specific
vendor. GrokVoiceBackend requires a real API key via environment variable
and raises a clear, descriptive error if not configured -- it never
silently no-ops or fabricates a response on a *configuration* problem.
NullVoiceBackend is the safe default for tests and offline/text-only
operation.

    A synchronous request/response chat completion is enough to satisfy

    realtime audio streaming remains separate future work if/when Angel
    needs actual voice rather than text chat.

    Model name and endpoint verified against xAI's live docs
    (docs.x.ai, checked 2026-07-08): "grok-beta" was retired as of
    xAI's May 15, 2026 model deprecation and now silently auto-redirects
    to grok-4.3 at standard grok-4.3 pricing. Updated to request
    "grok-4.3" explicitly rather than relying on that redirect. The
    `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint itself is still live but is now
    documented by xAI as a "legacy" surface -- new features land on
    their Responses API (`/v1/responses`) first. Kept on chat/completions
    here since it satisfies this class's stateless request/response
    contract and migrating to Responses is a separate, larger change.
    Still [Unverified] against a live GROK_API_KEY -- confirmed against
    current docs, not yet exercised against a real account.

"""Shared-secret authentication for the two server-to-server endpoints that
have no browser caller and are therefore not in ScopedCORSMiddleware's
CORS-scoped set: /book and /webhooks/ghl. Both previously accepted
`tenant_id` -- a public value, returned in API responses and embedded in
generated-site page source -- as if it were a credential, with no auth of
any kind; this module closes that gap.

Same Null-object + env-driven pattern as retell.py's RetellWebhookVerifier:
an unset secret falls back to a Null verifier that accepts everything
(consistent with NullVoiceBackend/NullGHLClient/NullRetellWebhookVerifier),
so tests and a not-yet-configured deployment never require credentials to
run. Once the relevant env var is set, a missing or mismatched header is
rejected with 401.

[Inference]: this closes the gap only once the founder actually sets
GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET / BOOK_API_KEY as real deployment secrets -- an
unconfigured instance is unchanged from today (open). That's a deliberate
continuation of this repo's existing convention (Retell's own webhook
verification has the identical unconfigured-fail-open shape), not a
compromise unique to this fix. Flagged explicitly rather than silently
matched, since "auth that doesn't protect until configured" is a real
tradeoff worth the founder knowing about, not assuming away.

This is a minimal shared-secret header, not a full auth system -- no
sessions, no per-caller identity, no token expiry/rotation. That's a
deliberate choice ("even a minimal shared-secret/API-key header" beats
none) rather than building a larger auth system, which is out of MVP
scope per CLAUDE.md.

"""Per-trade presentation hints for the intake form.

Presentation-layer only -- none of this affects the intake_submissions
schema (webstaffr/migrations/0003_intake_submissions.sql), which is the
same for every industry. What varies per trade is: example/placeholder
text shown while filling out the form, and which field-service-management
software options are offered.

Ported from the legacy webstaff repo's intake/intake.html (TRADE_HINTS,
INDUSTRY_SOFTWARE) and builder/site_generator.py (INDUSTRY_PRESETS'
default_services) -- see the CLAUDE.md session addendum for provenance.
Values are illustrative placeholder copy, not real business data.

SUPPORTED_INDUSTRIES narrowed to WebStaffr's priority trade list
(founder direction, 2026-07-27): the trades where speed-to-lead most
directly determines whether a call turns into revenue -- emergency
demand, high-LTV jobs, or both. Contractor/Restaurant/Med Spa/Dentist/
Salon (the prior list) are dropped from the curated set; "Other" stays
as the always-available fallback so intake never hard-fails for a
business type outside this list.

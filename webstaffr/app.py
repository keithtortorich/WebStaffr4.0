"""Composition root -- builds the FastAPI app and wires every router.

This is the single place that assembles the full HTTP surface: Angel
(chat/book/GHL-webhook), Retell voice webhooks, intake, site-data,
attribution, and the two integration bridges (social-media-marketing,
workflow-graph). A future AI-employee worker (e.g. Marketing
Coordinator) adds its own router here, as a sibling to Angel's -- never
nested inside workers/angel/.

Split out of workers/angel/router.py during the WebStaffr 4.0 rebuild:
that file had grown into both the app factory AND Angel's own
endpoints, which buried this repo's actual composition root four
directories deep, under one specific AI worker's package. Angel's own
request/response models and endpoint handlers stayed in
workers/angel/router.py as create_angel_router(); this file combines
everything into one FastAPI app.
